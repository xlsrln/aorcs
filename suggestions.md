# Suggestions for aorc

## General community
* A feedback channel would remove most of the heated discussion from the general chat
* The stages and results should be published in a text format and not only as images

## Rule book
* To reduce the friction of new players joining, and simplify the application of the rules, the wording and structure of the rule book has to be significantly revised and simplified. For inspiration I have a suggestion of an outline [here](https://github.com/xlsrln/aorcs/blob/main/rules.md)
* The multi-level structure of checklist, short rules, and extended rules should go: focus on the important rules at the top and put the nitty gritty (livery rules, edge cases, ...) in an appendix or something

## Format changes

* Limit the competition to one class to not dilute the player pool
* Stage selection should use more of the available stages avoid repeats (including weather or direction)
* If a stage has known issues (e.g. the kvannkjosen jump) it sh/could be avoided
* Weather selection should follow some temporal logic or narrative, such as morning -> afternoon -> sunset -> night or similar
* Power stage on the last stage of the rally
* Remove the DNS penalties, as not getting any points is already penalty enough
