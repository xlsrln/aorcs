# Suggestions for aorc

## General community
* A feedback channel would remove most of the heated discussion from the general chat
* The stages and results should be published in a text format and not only as images

## Rule book
* To reduce the friction of new players joining, and simplify the application of the rules, the wording and structure of the rule book has to be significantly revised and simplified. For inspiration I have a suggestion of an outline [here](https://github.com/xlsrln/aorcs/blob/main/rules.md)

## Format changes

* Limit the competition to one class to not dilute the player pool
* Stage selection should avoid repeats of stages
* If a stage has known issues (e.g. the kvannkjosen jump) it sh/could be avoided
* Weather selection should follow some temporal logic or narrative, such as morning -> afternoon -> sunset -> night or similar
* Power stage on the last stage of the rally
* DNS penalties should be removed, as not getting any points is already penalty enough
